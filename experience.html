            Hi there, you are already familiar with who i am and what i do and some of my projects but i wanted to make a more personal chat about some of my experiences through life.<br>
            If you already dont know i am a gay man and this has affected my life quite alot and has completely altered my life so i wanted to share my experiences with you.<br>
            Although i have came to accept myself for who i am i know i will get judged by some people in real life for something i have no control over and i have experienced hate for being gay.<br><br>
            Even though these comments do affect me it still wont stop me from being who i am and i will stand againt the hate and help people in need who cant fight for themselves.<br>
            I do this because even though i may not know them they are still human and everyone deserves a voice to be heard and helped if they are struggling or need someone to reach out to.<br>
            everyone is human and should be treated as such even if they are different from the average person.
